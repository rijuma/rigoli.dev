## A Ruby on Rails + React hybrid

I've joined Mejuri at a time when the stack was an weird mixture between [Spree Commerce](https://spreecommerce.org) (an eCommerce platform made in Ruby on Rails) and React. At that point the stack wasn't taking advantage of React as a frontend, since every navigation would require a full re-render.

The stack also suffered with high loads on the servers that limited each one to respond to serve to only a few hundred users each instance. We started thinking on alternatives on how to modernize the platform.

## The React way

The idea of migrating the site to a SPA for a better user experience was presented to the team, and we started working. The Spree version was a bit old, but it already had a full API for the checkout and we thought that was a good place to start since the checkout had a limited functionality and could be isolated as a different process.

## Leading

At six months of joining the company, I was promoted to Technical Lead, leading a small team of devs (3 junior/ssr devs) for several projects, including the previously mentioned migration.

## Offboarding

After one and a half years, and two Black Fridays to remember a new opportunity presented to work as a contractor at 2U. Besides being able to negotiate a better salary and commodities, the idea of working on a company which tailored tools for universities with a "no back row" slogan looked very promising for me, and decided to move on.
