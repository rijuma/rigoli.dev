## React was love at first sight

At the time, I was experienced in PHP, with a few tricks in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (back in the jQuery days). But when I joined Making Sense, everything started to connect. I was lucky enough to work with a team of ReactJS experts who showed me the way, and I was also introduced to the fundamentals of design.

My role was somewhat of a middle ground—between the so-called "frontend backenders" (devs who were experts in ReactJS but lacked UI experience). ReactJS was a trending new technology at the time, bringing a whole new paradigm: components, routing, state management with Redux. The level of abstraction ReactJS introduced—at least within our team—led to a split between the project’s frontend logic and the more UI- and style-focused work.

On the other hand, I also took part in workshops that explored design concepts such as the 70/20/10 rule, layout spacing, hierarchy, font selection, and much more.

I recall it as one of the most enriching experiences I’ve had—each week felt like a crash course in something new. I really appreciated the dynamic of the team and came to understand the value of workshops, continuous learning, and constant improvement.

## Offboarding

Argentina was going through a rough time; devaluation was hitting hard, and the idea of working remotely for a foreign company with a much stronger currency was tempting. A new opportunity came up with an offshore company, so I took my chances and leapt forward.
