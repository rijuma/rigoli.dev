## The beginning of my love for frontend

I was experienced in PHP at that time, with a few tricks on HTML, CSS and Javascript (jQuery days), but when I joined Making Sense everything started to connect. I was lucky enough to work in a team with several ReactJS experts that showed me the way, but I was also introduced in the ways of design.

My position was a middle ground between the "frontend backenders" sort of speak (Devs who were experts in the ReactJS ways but lacked UI experience). ReactJS was a new trending technology at that time and it was a whole new paradigm. Components, routing, state management like Redux. The abstraction that ReactJS brought into the table, at least on my team, lead to split the work between the project's frontend logic and the more strictly UI and style work.

In the other hand, I was also part of workshops that explored design concepts, like 70/20/10, understand layout spacing, hierarchy, font choice, and so much more.

I recall it as one of the most enriched experiences I've had where every week was a new crash course into something new. I really liked the dynamic of the team I was in, and understand the value of workshops and constant learning and improvement.

## Offboarding

The only thing this company was lacking was a proper salary. Our economy was having a bad time and the wage at that moment was roughly enough to make ends meet. A new opportunity came up on an offshore company with a significant salary increase which at the time I really needed, so I moved forward.
